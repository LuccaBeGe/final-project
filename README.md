## Description

### The project

This project was created as a course conclusion project for my electronics course at the technical school I attend. The objective was to conduct research on a population by providing them, in an app format, with three different methods for focusing on studies. The population used for the research consisted of three first-year classes. They will use the app for six weeks, alternating between methods every two weeks. The project is still ongoing, and the objective is to determine which method was the most acceptable among the population.

### The APP

#### Pomodoro Method
The Pomodoro Technique was developed in the late 1980s by Francesco Cirillo, an Italian university student. Cirillo was having trouble concentrating on his studies and decided to use a tomato-shaped kitchen timer (hence the name "Pomodoro," which means "tomato" in Italian) to help improve his productivity.

The Pomodoro Technique is a simple tool based on three pillars: an alternative perspective on time management, enhanced mental efficiency, and the adoption of more accessible and easy-to-use tools. It involves breaking down a task into predefined periods of time, called "pomodoros," followed by short breaks. For example: 25 minutes of focus and 10 minutes of break, with a longer break after every four pomodoros. It is a technique known for reducing anxiety, decreasing mental fatigue, and improving work quality.

The Pomodoro method presented in this app consists of three cycles: one cycle is determined by the focus time, which can be configured by clicking on the numbers on the timer on the screen, and 10 minutes of break. It is possible to pause the timer during the execution of the method. You can also restart the session, which will reset the timer to its initial time and the cycle count to its initial value.

#### Binaural Beats
Between 1924 and 1929, German psychiatrist Hans Berger accidentally discovered the existence of high and low frequencies in the brain by performing the first electroencephalogram (EEG), where electrodes are placed on a person’s head, allowing the monitoring of electrical activity in the brain. His study method led to the discovery of five brain wave frequencies: Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma. Each of these waves is associated with an emotional state, such as relaxation, focus, attention, and others, which can be influenced by the use of binaural beats. A binaural beat occurs when two tones of slightly different frequencies, but close to and below 1kHz, are presented to each ear, creating a 3D audio effect. For example, when a 510Hz tone is heard in the right ear and a 500Hz tone is heard in the left ear, a binaural beat is created as the brain compensates for the 10Hz difference. Beta waves, 13Hz to 30Hz, are associated with attention, focus, concentration, and awareness. These waves are crucial for creative processes, as they aid concentration, perception, and caution for activities requiring heightened attention or personal development, such as learning tasks. For these reasons, the frequency used in this app’s method is Beta.

To use this method, you need to be in a quiet place and have stereo headphones (with audio output for the left and right ears). Under these conditions, you can choose between two options: 1) Select one of the three available tracks and listen to it. Each track lasts 10 minutes, and you only need to listen to one before a study session. Think of this as a meditation. 2) Do your study activities while listening to the soundtrack. Either option will stimulate focus on your tasks! This method may cause discomfort to people with sensitive hearing.

#### Eisenhower matrix
The Eisenhower Matrix originates with the 34th President of the United States, Dwight D. Eisenhower, who governed the country from 1953 to 1961. The president was known for his excellent time management and task organization skills. The technique involves organizing a matrix by classifying tasks according to two fundamental criteria: urgency and importance. At the top are "Urgent" tasks, which must be completed in the short term; next to them are "Not Urgent" tasks, which have deadlines but are not as urgent as others; below are the non-important tasks, representing distractions or low-relevance activities, and the "Urgent but Not Important" tasks, which are largely unwanted interruptions. The Eisenhower Matrix provides a structured approach to prioritize tasks based on their importance and urgency, facilitating time management and more effective decision-making.

To use the matrix, simply click on the field where you want to add your tasks, write them down, and then click the button to add them to the task list in the matrix. The list of added activities follows the order of importance as per the matrix, where the first tasks are the most urgent and important. To mark a task as completed, click the box next to it; the box will be filled, and the task will have a completion indicator, the text will change to gray and have a strike-through. Tasks can be individually removed from the to-do list by clicking the "x" icon next to the text. If the list becomes "outdated," simply click the "Reset List" button to clear it and start a new one from scratch! This method includes built-in notifications. The highest priority activity that has not been marked as completed will notify the user. The notification frequency will increase depending on the classification of its importance and urgency.

### Extras

#### Desing
The design of the app was created on Canva. For this task, my project partner, who studies graphic design, helped me, and we looked at other app screens for inspiration. The background was designed by my partner and is present on every screen of the app. The purpose of the design was to be simple and inviting to the user.

#### Help tab
This tab contains useful information for the user, such as: the contact details of the researchers, the terms that were agreed upon before starting the experiment, and the instructions for each method. The instructions appear on the screen in a pop-up box format automatically the first time a method is used and can be viewed again by clicking on the '?' in the top-left corner of each method screen or in the instruction tab, inside the Help tab.
